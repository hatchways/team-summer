### Prerequisites
#### Setting up MongoDB
You wil need MongoDB to run this app. You can download it [here](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community). Then in your /server .env file, add your mongo uri as MONGO_URI. You can generally find your mongo uri as the port where your MongoDB is running followed by /`Name of the database`
Ex: `mongodb://localhost:{PORT NUMBER}/{DATABASE NAME}` The default port is usually 27017.

#### Setting up AWS
You will also need proper AWS credentials to run this app locally. You can sign up for a free account [here](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). Once signed up look  "My Security Credentials" in the drop down menu under your name on the upper right corner of the AWS navigation bar. Under access keys, generate your `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` keys and place them in your /server .env file. Create a new bucket in the AWS s3 service and take note of the name of the bucket as well as the region you select. Save these variables as `AWS_REGION` and `AWS_BUCKET`respectively. For development make sure in the permissions tab of your bucket, turn OFF "Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new access control lists (ACLs)" and "Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any access control lists (ACLs)

#### Setting up Stripe
Create a Stripe account at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com/). Save the secret key and the public key -- there will be a test and a live version for each.
Add the public key to the client .env as REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
Add the secret key to the server .env as STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
On the client side install react-stripe-elements. On the server install stripe.

You can find test card numbers and tokens at [stripe.com/docs/testing#cards](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards)
